The Multiple Select source code download includes the precompiled CSS, JavaScript, and provides both compiled and minified variations, along with documentation. More specifically, it includes the following and more:

```bash
bootstrap-show-password/
├── docs/
├── bootstrap-show-password.js
└── bootstrap-show-password.min.js
```

The `src/`, are the source code for our CSS, JS. The `dist/` folder includes everything compiled and minified with `src/`. The `docs/` folder includes the source code for our documentation. Beyond that, any other included file provides support for packages, license information, and development.
